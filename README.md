# Blockchain-Group-Project-Polymarket
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Polymarket, a leading blockchain-based prediction market platform. The report begins by outlining Polymarket’s purpose and functionality, explaining how it leverages blockchain building blocks such as smart contracts, fungible tokens, decentralized oracles, and Web3 wallet integration to ensure transparency, security, and accessibility.

The study examines the key problems Polymarket addresses, including inefficiency in aggregating collective wisdom, lack of incentives for accurate predictions, and transparency issues in centralized platforms. It highlights how Polymarket creates value for users through mechanisms like its Liquidity Provider Programme and social media features that enhance engagement and community building.

A detailed SWOT analysis evaluates Polymarket’s strengths (public attention, transparency, accessibility), weaknesses (niche liquidity, regulatory issues), opportunities (integration with media, market expansion), and threats (legal uncertainty, market manipulation).

The report concludes that Polymarket represents a paradigm shift in prediction markets, offering a more decentralized, transparent, and user-driven ecosystem. While regulatory challenges remain its biggest obstacle, Polymarket demonstrates significant potential to reshape forecasting, financial speculation, and collective intelligence in the Web3 space.
